If you want to avoid the risk of downloading and using unreliable or illegal software, you can also try to find your radio code in other ways.

You can also check the stickers or labels on your car or radio, as some manufacturers may print the code there. Alternatively, you can contact your dealer or manufacturer and provide them with your car details and proof of ownership. They may be able to give you the code or reset it for you.
